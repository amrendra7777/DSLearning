# NLP Project

I want to make this project as my mini project in the college.

# What this does

It takes the syllabus from the student and extract the text from that pdf. 
Now it uses nlp to understand that text and we use the machine learning algorithms to take out insigts from that text.
After all this, we want the student to participate in a test where we will find out his learning type.
After finding which type of learner they are, we  will tell our model to generate a roadmap that suits the student best.
